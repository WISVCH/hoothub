CH Dienstensysteem: administration of members, cash and the mail

CH Dienst is CH's own implementation of an administration system. The system has been around for a while, and is currently being adjusted for small improvements that make the life of our secretary just a bit easier. Dienst is written in Python using the Django framework. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/WISVCH/dienst2) and has a selection of issues for the HootHub program. Not all issues are part of the program, so make sure to look out for the HootHub label!

Project manager for Dienst is Jeffrey de Lange [@jgadelange](https://github.com/jgadelange)
