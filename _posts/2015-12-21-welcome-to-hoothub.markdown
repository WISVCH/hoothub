### Introduction
As a Computer Science and Mathematics Study Association, CH is the perfect place to build awesome applications and gain some valuable development experience. Courses will teach you the theory, but actually building something is the real fun part. If you're looking for something fun to do in your spare time or while evading your deadlines, HootHub is the perfect place to start. HootHub offers various projects in different area's and stages of development. Check the homepage for an overview of projects that are currently available. 

HootHub is specifically meant for students who don't have a lot of experience with real-life development projects. Every project has small tasks of various difficulty which anyone should be able to do. With HootHub, you can work on tasks of various projects and earn HootHub Points (called Uilenballen) for your efforts. These points unlock experience levels and levels unlock some awesome rewards!

There is one common aspect of software development which you should know before starting on a task, and that is Git. You might have learned a thing or two about this during your projects and courses, but it is important that you have a good understanding before you start. Don't worry, you will need knowledge about Git later in your studies, and there's absolutely no harm in learning it sooner then later. We gathered some useful learning resources which you can use. See the next chapter for details. 

If you have any questions left about a project, required skill or do you have an idea that can make HootHub better? Drop by at the #hoothub channel on [Slack](https://wisvch.slack.com/). For a project/issue specific question, you can also place a comment in the relevant issue. Don't hesitate to ask, we're here to help!

### Git basics
The internet is full of Git tutorials. We made a selection of excellent guides which you can choose from. They all at least the same basics, so you can choose any one of them. Next to these basics, you should also read [GitHub's explanation on the Git Flow principle](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

### Your first task
After you got the basics of Git, it's time to choose your first task! Every HootHub project is hosted in GitHub, which is a code hosting website which provides a lot of useful tools for software development. You will learn how to use this on the go, but you can always checkout the excellent [Github help section](https://help.github.com/). The first thing you should check out is the issues page of every project. The Issues page lists every task that needs to be completed. Issues also have labels, which are shown next to the title. Issues marked with HootHub can be picked up by you! Every HootHub issue also has a number of points assigned to it. The more work the task is, the more points you get. Points are always related to the estimated amount of time a task will take. 

After you found a task you want to work on, assign yourself to the issue (in the right hand menu). This way other people will know that someone is working on the task. Before you start, create a new branch following the naming convention of the project (check the project README for details). All your changes should be in this branch, which is your own personal copy of the code. 

When you think you're done with the task, it's time to have it checked by the project managers. To request a Code Review, create a pull request. See the [Github help section](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on creating pull requests for details. Also check the project README for possible extra things you need to do when creating a pull request. Project managers will automatically be notified of every new pull request. A manager will check your work, and provide feedback. After this, the manager will assign the pull request to you so you can process the feedback and improve your code. When you're done, assign the pull request back to the manager. This process can repeat itself until the manager is happy with the changes. The pull request will then me merged with the existing code and you will get the points assigned to the task!
