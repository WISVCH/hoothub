CHoice exam database is the central place where CH keeps old exams for practice.

CHoice is CH's system that's currently integrated into the website that contains all the old exams that were provided by members. The system can only be managed by both commissioners of education and isn't as widely known or used as it could be. Therefore, this system needs to be redesigned and rebuilt for better use. Used technology isn't determined yet, nor is the general design finished. If you would like to take the initiative on this project and help improve the education for your fellow students? Let your commissioner of education know. 

The project managers are [Beer van der Drift](https://github.com/bvanderdrift) and [Sille Kamoen](https://github.com/skamoen)
