Registration for CH events (lectures, workshops, excursions, ...)

The Event system is meant to replace the current enrollment system through Google Forms. This project is currently in early development phase and is currently focussed on delivering a MVP (Minimally Viable Product). Events is using the Java-based Spring framework. While Spring may seem overwhelming at first, getting started on this project doesn't require advanced knowledge of Java. In this project you'll learn about the MVC architecture and the REST principle. See [the Github repo](https://github.com/WISVCH/events) for more information and HootHub assignments in the "Issues" section!

Project manager for this project is Mark Janssen [@praseodym ](https://github.com/praseodym).
